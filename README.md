This project is an AI-powered job recommendation platform designed to match candidates with the best-fit job opportunities based on their resume data. It leverages NLP techniques to extract key information (skills, education, experience) from uploaded resumes and uses content-based filtering to recommend relevant jobs.  Key Features 📄 Resume Parsing: Supports DOCX and PDF formats, with OCR for scanned files.  🧠 Entity Extraction: Automatically extracts skills, experience, education, and location using spaCy.  🔥 Job Matching: Calculates similarity between candidate profiles and job postings.  ⚡ FastAPI Backend: Handles resume upload, parsing, and recommendation generation.  🎯 React Frontend: Simple and intuitive interface for users to upload resumes and view personalized job matches.  🛢️ PostgreSQL Database: Stores parsed resume information and job postings for efficient querying.  Tech Stack Frontend: React.js  Backend: FastAPI (for parsing and matching services)  Database: PostgreSQL  NLP: spaCy, scikit-learn  Storage: AWS S3 (optional for file uploads)  How It Works User uploads a resume.  The system parses the resume and extracts structured data.  The extracted profile is matched against available job listings.  The user receives a ranked list of recommended jobs based on profile-job similarity.  Future Improvements 🎯 Integrate ML-based learning from user interactions to improve recommendations.  🌍 Add location-based filtering for better regional job matches.  🔒 Enhance security for resume data handling and storage.
